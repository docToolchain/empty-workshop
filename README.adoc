== Empty Repository

This is just an empty repository to play around with some Diagrams-as-Code tools.

To open this repository in gitpod, just preface the URL with `gitpod.io#`.

Next, gitpod will start a web based visual studio instance with everything pre-installed.

Open this `README.adoc` and press `Ctrl+k` then `v` to aktivate the AsciiDoc preview.

There are some german exercises which can be found at https://doctoolchain.org/empty-workshop/Uebungen.html .

Now open xref:src/docs/diagrams-as-code.adoc[] and start hacking.

To install _docToolchain_, switch to the terminal and run

To preview the files, start a small server from within the terminal:

Gitpod will now ask you what to do with the opened port. Just click on "open in browser" and navigate through the `build` folder.
