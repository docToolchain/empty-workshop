== Empty Repository

This is just an empty repository to play around with some Diagrams-as-Code tools.

To open this repository in gitpod, just preface the URL with `gitpod.io#`.

Next, gitpod will start a web based visual studio instance with everything pre-installed.

Open this `README.adoc` and press `Ctrl+k` then `v` to aktivate the AsciiDoc preview.

Now open xref:src/docs/diagrams-as-code.adoc[] and start hacking.
